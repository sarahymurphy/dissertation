%% MEASUREMENTS
% N-ICE
The N-ICE field campaign was supported by the Norwegian Polar Institute's Centre for Ice, Climate and Ecosystems (ICE) through the N-ICE project, and the Research Council of Norway through the STASIS project (221961/F20). 

% SCGSR Fellowship
The modeling using the idealized version of WRF and the flux equation research (Chapters 5 and 6) were partially supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists, Office of Science Graduate Student Research (SCGSR) program. The SCGSR program is administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) for the DOE. ORISE is managed by ORAU under contract number DE‐SC0014664. All opinions expressed in this document are the author’s and do not necessarily reflect the policies and views of DOE, ORAU, or ORISE.

% Cheyenne
NCAR's Cheyenne supercomputer was used for all Polar WRF simulations except for the idealized WRF simulations. We would like to acknowledge high-performance computing support from Cheyenne (doi:10.5065/D6RX99HX) provided by NCAR's Computational and Information Systems Laboratory, sponsored by the National Science Foundation.

%% PYTHON
The author would like to thank the Python community for the open-source data science tools, including wrf-python \citep{wrfpython}, xarray \citep{xarray}, and matplotlib \citep{matplotlib}. All were used extensively throughout this dissertation. 

%% PEOPLE
Chapter 3 was made possible with help from Dr. Keith Hines (Polar Meteorology Group, Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center at The Ohio State University), who provided useful insight to help get the Polar WRF model running on the Washington State University supercomputer. Dr. Hines also assisted in some early decisions regarding the setup of Polar WRF, including insight into input data sets and formatting of WRF configuration files.

Dr. Xiang-Yu Li (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) helped with the setup of the idealized WRF model and troubleshooting some model issues. The author would like to thank him for the helpful conversations and for taking the time to help translate WRF error files.

Dr. Lana Cohen provided research advice from the perspective of someone who was on the ship at N-ICE and helped clarify some of the caveats of the measurement data. Conversations with her have helped with the details of Chapters 2 and 3. 

This research for this dissertation was supported by the National Science Foundation grants PLR-1304657, PLR-1314248, NNA-1801764, OPP-2110341.
